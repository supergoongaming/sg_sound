## Development
- Mostly developed on macos apple silicon
- Going to build on Mac, Linux, Windows, Emscripten throughout development

## Goals
- Better at C
- Create a simple "Geometry Dash" clone.
- Better at cross-platform building (Macos, Linux, Windows)
- Learn github actions, as we should be building these here
#### Stretch Goals
- Game build on Mobile (IOS priority)

## Building
- If you have the libraries installed, just use the make rebuild command
- Otherwise, use the full builds in the makefile for your platform

## Current State
- Loads a tilemap and draws it to the screen.
- Currently no gameobjects.
- Builds on all platforms in runners.

## Requirements
- Cmake will install all of the required libraries with all of the rebuild commands in make except "rebuild".

## Components
- CMake: The actual cross-platform build system.
- SDL2: Low Level handling of windowing, events, input
- Make: Streamlining building with one command
- Emscripten: Build for web
- Lua: Embedded Scripting

## Documentation
- Hosted on docs.supergoon.com, generated by doxygen.  Not created yet.

### ZeroBrane Debugging notes
- Had to build luasocket from source, as the one from luarocks didn't build right for arm
- Had to get the build command from the mac.cmd file, and use that
- Had to remove -bundle and use these changes:
-LDFLAGS_macosx= -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -o
+LDFLAGS_macosx=  -undefined dynamic_lookup -dynamiclib -o
- Had to rename the files and put in a shared lib local location, as for some reason it references core in different places (socket-3.0.0)
- Now when you run (with make run) it will trigger breakpoints set in zerobrane after you start the server.
